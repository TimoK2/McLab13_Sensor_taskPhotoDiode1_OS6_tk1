The code is developed for the hardware NUCLEO-L432KC or any other board
with SPI communication and the Digilent Pmod ALS1 ambient light sensor module.
This version of code works with a photo diode and operational amplifier. The
amplifier circuit feedback resistor value and capasitor value define the
gain and the time constant. 
The purpose is to make students to understand the development process.
